changes: 
  - rscadd: "Syndicate Contracts. Use the new contract uplink to select a contract, and bring the assigned target dead or alive to the designated drop off. Call for the extraction pod and send them off for your TC payment, with much higher rewards for keeping them alive. A high risk, high reward choice for a traitor who wants a real challenge."
  - rscadd: "New 20 TC contract kit - supplies you with your contractor loadout and uplink."
  - rscadd: "Targets successfully extracted will be held for ransom by the Syndicate after their use to them is fulfilled. Central command covers the cost, but they'll be taking a cut out of station funds to offset their loss..."
  - rscadd: "Contractor Hub. A unique store for contractors to buy items with Contractor Rep, with two Rep being given when completing a contract."
  - rscadd: "Contract kit comes with a contractor baton - a unique, lightly electrified weapon to help complete your contracts."
  - rscadd: "Contractor pinpointer, available through the Hub. A very inaccurate pinpointer that ignores suit sensors."
  - rscadd: "Call reinforcements, available through the Hub. Limited to a one-time buy for a contractor, you can purchase an agent to be sent down to help in your mission. Role is polled to ghosts."
  - rscadd: "Blackout, available through the Hub. Disable station power for a small duration - an expensive, but powerful option of getting into secure areas."
  - rscadd: "Fulton extraction, available through the Hub. Purchase a fulton extraction kit to help move your targets across the station for those difficult dropoffs."
  - tweak: "Assigning yourself to another tablet will give you another contract set."
  - rscadd: "Contractor buys show on roundend"
  - rscadd: "Brand new sprites! Contractor kit's own unique tablet. Done by Mey Ha Zah."
  - soundadd: "Added CJ voice clip as round end sound."
  - rscadd: "Added new font-awesome files ready for future PR."
  - tweak: "Sleeping carp now requires a minimum of 20 people to be available via the uplink"
